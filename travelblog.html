                <p>During the summer months, Snow City is the best to get some relief from the heat. It is made with artificial snow which is safe as they have used eco-friendly techniques. Also, it has a 5D theatre which is another attraction in the theme park. Moreover, you do not need to carry any of your woolen garments such as sweaters, jackets, gloves, and boots. All of these are available at the entrance.
